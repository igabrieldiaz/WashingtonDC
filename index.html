    <p>Washington DC has been in a long fight for fair representation in Congress. Itâ€™s time for this country to rightfully recognize Washington DC as a state and give the people of the great region the power and voice that they have been denied for far too long. DC residents have been contributing more than their fair share to the country, from GDP and federal taxes, to history, culture, and higher education.</p>
